# Module 4 Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/zOTfhcK-Wf4" %}

### What do we achieve with P2P

* With automatic P2P, (registered) nodes can discover and establish connections with each other&#x20;
* Nodes can establish full duplex  connections (simultaneous server and client side of the mini-protocols)
* Nodes can maintain some static topology i.e. its own relays and bp, and trusted peers with which we always want to keep a connection.&#x20;
* RootPeers reload with SIGHUP signal, no need to restart.&#x20;
*   The node dynamically manages the connections:  Each node maintains a set of peers mapped into three categories:

    * **cold peers** ‒ existing (known) peers without an established network connection
    * **warm peers** ‒ peers with an established bearer connection, which is only used for network measurements without implementing any of the node-to-node mini-protocols (not active).
    * **hot peers** ‒ peers that have a connection, which is being used by all three node-to-node mini-protocols (active peers)

    Newly discovered peers are initially added to the cold peer set. The P2P governor is then responsible for peer connection management.
* Maintaining diversity in hop distances contributes to better block distribution times across the globally distributed network.
* In the case of adversarial behavior, the peer can be immediately demoted from the hot, warm, or cold sets.

We classify upstream peers in 3 nested categories: Known/Established/Active

### The P2P topology file :&#x20;

The network stack for P2P introduces the following concepts:

**Local Root Peers:** Local configured peers that the node should know and try to maintain a connection with. These are usually BPs or Relays that SPOs setup. These ought to be private.

**Public Root Peers:** Peers from a trusted public source such as IOG relays domain name. These peers are important to have since they are a source of trusted peers, if no local root peers are configured. They differ from Local Root Peers in the fact that the node does not have to guarantee any type of invariant regarding connectivity to public root peers. They are mostly a source of peers to meet other targets such as Known Peers.

**Bootstrap peers:** Can be understood as the same as Public Root Peers, with the exception/restriction that they should absolutely be from trustworthy sources. They also differ from the Public Root Peers in the sense that they will be used as a fallback for when the node is too far behind the tip.

**Ledger Peers:** Peers that are registered in the ledger. These usually come from lpGetPeers

**Shared Peers:** Peers that are known due to Peer Sharing protocol. These can be any kind of peer, e.g. ledger peer or a wallet peer.

### Example of a topology file for a node not involved in block production or block propagation

* As a node that is not involved in block production/propagation we don't need local roots, we can put IOG relays under **Public Roots**.&#x20;
* **Advertise** field does not have any effect at the moment. It is intended for later when peer sharing is released.&#x20;
* Note that we are using    `"useLedgerAfterSlot":0` This will disable Ledger peers the first time we run the node, i.e. joining the network for the first time, the next time we run the node, it will pick-up ledger peers.&#x20;

```json
{
   "localRoots":[
      {
         "accessPoints":[
         ],
         "advertise":false,
         "valency":1
      }
   ],
   "publicRoots":[
      {
         "accessPoints":[
            {
               "address":"preview-node.world.dev.cardano.org",
               "port":30002
            }
         ],
         "advertise":false
      }
   ],
   "useLedgerAfterSlot":0
}
```

### Example of topology files for a stake pool

### Block Producer

* The block-producer node includes it's own relays (`x.x.x.x` and `y.y.y.y`) under **Local Roots.**
* **Advertise** is not used, this is for use when peer sharing is released.&#x20;
* The value of **valency** must equal the number of local roots in that group.&#x20;
* Do not use **Public Roots** in a block producer.
* Note that we use `"useLedgerAfterSlot": -1` to indicate that it should never use LedgerPeers.

```json
{
   "localRoots":[
      {
         "accessPoints":[
            {
               "address":"x.x.x.x",
               "port":3000
            },
            {
               "address":"y.y.y.y",
               "port":3000
            }
         ],
         "advertise":false,
         "valency":2
      }
   ],
   "publicRoots":[
      {
         "accessPoints":[
         ],
         "advertise":false
      }
   ],
   "useLedgerAfterSlot":-1
}
```

### Relays

* The relay `x.x.x.x`  includes its own block producer node (`z.z.z.z`) and the other relay (`y.y.y.y`) under local roots.&#x20;
* Again,  value of valency must equal the number of local roots in that group, so it's 2. &#x20;
* We can have other peers under public roots.&#x20;
* On relays we do want to use LedgerPeers, thus we use `"useLedgerAfterSlot": 10000000`

```json
{
   "localRoots":[
      {
         "accessPoints":[
            {
               "address":"z.z.z.z",
               "port":3000
            },
            {
               "address":"y.y.y.y",
               "port":3000
            }
         ],
         "advertise":false,
         "valency":2
      }
   ],
   "publicRoots":[
      {
         "accessPoints":[
            {
               "address":"preview-node.world.dev.cardano.org",
               "port":30002
            }
         ],
         "advertise":false
      }
   ],
   "useLedgerAfterSlot":1000000
}
```

### Relays with more than one group in local roots

Assume a.a.a.a is a DNS of a partner pool to which we always want to have a connection with. Let's say this DNS can resolve to 2 IPs. We want to have 1 "hot" connection to any of the resolved IPs without compromising our connections to our block producer z.z.z.z and our relay y.y.y.y; in that case we put them on separate groups:

```json
{
   "localRoots":[
      {
         "accessPoints":[
            {
               "address":"z.z.z.z",
               "port":3000
            },
            {
               "address":"y.y.y.y",
               "port":3000
            }
         ],
         "advertise":false,
         "valency":2
      },
      {
         "accessPoints":[
            {
               "address":"a.a.a.a",
               "port":3000
            },
         ],
         "advertise":false,
         "valency":1
      }
   ],
   "publicRoots":[
      {
         "accessPoints":[
            {
               "address":"preview-node.world.dev.cardano.org",
               "port":30002
            }
         ],
         "advertise":false
      }
   ],
   "useLedgerAfterSlot":1000000
} 
```

### Configuring the node to use P2P

To Enable P2P, we do it from the configuration file, take for example the Preview testnet [configuration file](https://book.world.dev.cardano.org/environments/preview/config.json), it contains the field  `"EnableP2P".` It can be set to `false` or `true`

For example, on Preview testnet the default is `true` since this network is already running with P2P.  We also need to configure the Target number of _Active_, _Established_ and _Known_ Peers, together with the target of _Root_ Peers

<pre><code>{
...
<strong>  "EnableP2P": true,
</strong>...
  "TargetNumberOfActivePeers": 20,
  "TargetNumberOfEstablishedPeers": 40,
  "TargetNumberOfKnownPeers": 100,
  "TargetNumberOfRootPeers": 100,
}
</code></pre>
